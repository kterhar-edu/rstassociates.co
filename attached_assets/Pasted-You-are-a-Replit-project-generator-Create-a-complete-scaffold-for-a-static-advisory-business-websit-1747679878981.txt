You are a Replit project generator. Create a complete scaffold for a static advisory‐business website for RST Associates, using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. Don’t write any backend code—focus on structure, responsiveness, and placeholders. The user will fill in real content later.

Requirements:

Project Structure

/index.html

/css/style.css

/js/app.js

/assets/logo.png (place the attached RST logo here)

Global Assets & Styling

Load Bootstrap 5 (CSS + JS bundle) via CDN

Load Google Fonts of your choice for headings + body

Use FontAwesome for any icons

Primary brand color: midnight blue

Add comments in style.css for where to override colors, typography, and spacing

index.html Template

<head> with meta tags for responsive design, page title placeholder, favicon placeholder

Hero Section at top:

Left: logo (/assets/logo.png)

Right: Headline placeholder (e.g. “Expert Treasury Risk Advisory for Banks”)

Sub‐headline / elevator pitch placeholder

Three CTA buttons:

Subscribe (Newsletter) – triggers email‐capture form

Subscribe (LinkedIn Blog) – links to LinkedIn newsletter URL

Get in Touch – opens a contact form modal

Summary of Services (one horizontal row of four Bootstrap cards):

Peer Benchmarking

Regulatory Remediation

Strategic Enhancements

Documentation Enhancements

Each card: icon placeholder, title, 1–2 line description placeholder

Projects Carousel:

Bootstrap carousel containing up to 8 cards

Each card:

Project Title placeholder

Project Subtitle placeholder

Body text placeholder (“Challenge / Solution / Outcome”)

Newsletter & Blog Section

Email Subscription Form with "Email address" input + “Subscribe” button

Form action can be a # placeholder or /subscribe endpoint

Include form validation by default (HTML5)

LinkedIn Blog Button: large button linking to your LinkedIn newsletter URL

Optionally include <iframe> or embed placeholder for future LinkedIn widget

Contact Form Modal (triggered by “Get in Touch”):

Fields: Name, Email, Message

Submit button that sends to info@rstassociates.co (mailto: link or placeholder POST)

Clear labels and placeholder attributes

Footer

Social icon links (LinkedIn, email)

Copyright notice

JavaScript (app.js)

Initialize Bootstrap components (e.g. carousel, modal)

Placeholder for form‐submission handlers (comments only)

Notes & Comments

Everywhere there is real copy or images needed, insert HTML comments like <!-- TODO: Replace with actual headline -->

Make sure all sections are mobile‐first and fully responsive

Include comments in HTML pointing out “where to inject widget code” for calendar or other embeds

Deployment

Ready to push to GitHub for hosting on GitHub Pages

No server requirements—purely static

Do not write any business logic or backend. Focus solely on the static scaffold, folder structure, CDN includes, and clear placeholder annotations so that the user can immediately start customizing.
